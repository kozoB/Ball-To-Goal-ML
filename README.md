# Ball-To-Goal-ML
## Reinforcement Learning sample project in which the ball has to get to the goal as fast as it can without touching any obstacles in the way.
### The project was made with Unity Game Engine (C# and Python's 'PyTorch' Library)
### Currently improving and experimenting with the model to make it better and for the ball to behave more natural

## Goals:
### * Get to the Green ball
### * Do it as fast as possible
### * Try to minimize air time
### * Don't touch the red platforms
